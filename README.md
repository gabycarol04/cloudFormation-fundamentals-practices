# AWS CloudFormation Fundamentals Practices

AWS CloudFormation enables you to model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources by treating your infrastructure as code.

In this repository, you will find a list of templates that serve as a practice to improve the creation of infrastructure as code with cloudformation.

## How to create AWS CloudFormation Stacks

- Enter the aws console 
- Select CloudFormation service
- Upload the template (any of the practices)s
- Select create stack

When the stack is created, the resourses established in the template are created automatically. In case the stack is deleted, the resources created with it will also be deleted.
